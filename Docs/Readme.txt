Description:
FC_Bans is the ultimate system for organized server moderation. This plugin allows you to handle normal moderation commands, but has a warning system that keeps a history of key information about each punishment dealt to players. The primary commands of this plugin are to ban, tempban, ipban, perm-ban, mute, tempmute, perma-mute, warn, kick, freeze, perma-freeze, tempfreeze, warn, and check players.

This plugin also has a few features that it comes with included into its normal moderation commands. Muted players can’t place signs, you can toggle whether or not to announce global announcements for punishments through a command, all punishing commands can have reasons added for recording history, players are informed as to when their punishments end, players can be given immunity, and all commands have full permission nodes so that you can define exactly what people can and can’t do.
