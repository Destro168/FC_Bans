~ FC_Bans Changelog ~

Version 2.5:

General:
- Very few and small optimizations and code improvements that I made.

peman-list:
- Fixed warning list being broken when removing warnings. Still nearly-impossible for me to optimize atm to be faster.
- New messages when you issue a punishment on a player telling you warning level and type of punishment as being successful.
- Fixed mute/freeze removing notifying wrong person.

Version 2.42:

- Updated to CB Beta 1.4.6-R0.3.
- Fixed issue where player names weren't probably able to get gotten from BanMsgLib.
