~ FC_Bans Changelog ~

Version 2.41:

- Compatability update with FC_Suite_Shared.
- Docs readded to jar file.
- Added in autoupdate.

Version 2.4:

This version is being released for compatibility with FC_Suite_Shared 2.0

Installation:
- FC_Suite_Shared is now it's own seperate plugin! Check it out -> http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/fc_suite_shared/

Todo:
- Pvp logger for FC_Bans that autowarns, optional punishment.
- Automatic reason append for bans.

Version 2.31:

- Check FC_Suite_Shared changelog!

Version 2.3:

- Uncommented out anti-multiaccounting mute avoidance feature.

Version 2.2:

- Built CB release - Build #2377 - CB 1.3.2-R2.0
- Add Ban giver/reason that players can see on relog attempts when banned. Requires setting -> DisplayWarnGiverNameOnPunish to be enabled.
- Abandoned warning that player is muted when you send commands to them. The old event.getRecips is decapritated and I can't find a suitable replacement. Maybe I'll add one day if I find one but until then abandoned.
- Fixed somewhat confusing issue where trying to ban offline players would would be impossible.
- Added a few older changelogs that I found.

Version 2.1:

- Corrected errors where commands were not returning. I don't know how the return statements got removed but they were.
- Fixed a lot of instances where using incomplete commands could cause errors. Now you will properly get denied messages.
- Make sure to read the FC_Suite_Shared changelog and make changes according to what it says.

Version 2.0:

- Added new configuration option, "enableBukkitBansSynergy". Check the front page for information about this feature. Took like 5 hours to get all this stuff together, ugh.
- There was a lot of testing done for offline-mode servers in this iteration. Offline mode servers can ip-ban and normally ban now if they have the new setting enabled.
- I hadn't noticed but they weren't properly ending the ban command function causing players to get banned twice which would just result in a "player is already banned, please remove ban" message.
- Check FC_Suite_Shared for what to do with player information. You have to move the player data into the player information section now if you want to keep your previous bans. FC_Suite_Shared also now hosted on github and it's link on the plugins changelog page and the readme for the FC_Bans package.
- Ips are now stored in a seperate file. This is the last time I'll be removing/renaming the section, haha, sorry about all the trouble on this. I'm very happy with my new file structure so this should be last time (as said in FC_Suite_Shared changelog) for all these kinds of moves. I'm trying to get my plugins to a more mature state. Feel free to let the file generate and then move your data into it, OR, you can create the file at ~/plugins/FC_Bans/ipLogging.yml and put your PlayerIps section and all the information inside of it into the ipLogging.yml file. Offline-mode servers don't need to do this because the multi-accounting features are disabled on them.

Version 1.2:

* Compiled on Build #2377 1.3.2-R1.0 Bukkit.
* Now have bans for players stored in seperate files in the FC_Suite_Shared folder. The first statup might be a little slow due to player information transfer (one time update thing).
* Recoded how commands are evaluated entirely so that I could add in as well a new debug option. Roughly 20.58% reduction to file size due to new method, cool.
* Optimized code a bit at the cost of readability, but may be more readable due to less code copying.
* New debug option. Disabled by default. Can be enabled to bypass command try/catches to show errors.
* Source can be found on github now, no longer included in package. Lots of file size decreases, weeee.
* Rainbows.
* (Todo) - log that startup will be slow for 1.2
* (Todo) - optimized transfer of player names
* (Todo) - Add a lot more logging, check for infinite loops.

Version 1.12:

* Updated freeze command to work better. Had to research "Player Join Event". Was using playerLogin event. Also makes it detect better materials to pass through on grounding players.
* Added reason tags to /fc_Bans 2 kick command help.
* Fixed capitalization for commands not registering them properly.
* Fixed commands with /fc_bans to work.
* Added command to disable the banned player join alert.
* Fixed Name Matching not properly matching!
* Updated the check (sub-)commands to match names now properly.
* Made it so that you can exclude a punishment reason and duration again for the default of "perm" to be used.

Changelog 1.11:

* Made it so that you have to remove punishments before you can apply a new one.
* Lots of minor cosmetic changes.
* Freeze command now has a 1 second delay. Automatically grounds the player. Uses exact coordinates of the player now to prevent suffocation issues.
* Made a proper error tag (FC_Suite_Shared) for error messages.
* Added ability to change check and freeze keywords now if you want to.
* Fixed FC_Bans being null when used from console.
* New config setting, ShowBannedPlayersAttemptedLogins which will show banned players attempted logons.
* When players log on, those that can see warnings will be alerted to the current mute/freeze status of players.
* Realized that I was using the player ips section for the recording of multi-account users, DURR. Don't delete that section and it's called "PlayerIps" again. Please just rename the section to "PlayerIps" if you want to preserve your old player names. Thank you and sorry about this, it's just a small fix.
* Didn't make a changelog sadly before so this is all you get. There are many more changes, just not listed. Will be actually making good changelogs from now on though. :D

Version 0.4:

* Fixed issue where my command blocker for muted players was overriding all commands that started with the blocked commands.
* Modularized and optimized code massively. Was really having a ton of fun with it this time. Spent a few hours just trying to make the code the best it could be. Trying to get on dat Essentials Level, haha.
* Check for permanent punishements are now stored in configuration as a boolean.
* Bad duration input should be correctly handled and a nice message displayed on fails. Success = warning list will be shown.
* Fixed unban date not being correct.
* No more double-logging for blocked commands.
* Fixed /warn check [name] to actually work now.
* Confirmation given on /warn remove command.
* Warning list for /warn command is only shown in /warn [name] command now.
* Removed plugin.yml permissions. Were just yucking up my permissions making them not work.
* Lots of really good output updates for notifying players why they are banned, how long, when players are muted, how long, perma status, on and on.

Version 0.3:

I would like to first and foremost say that this version is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. I have tested as much as I can, I really have, but I added so much stuff, that it is possible something isn't working. Anyway, there are tons of features in this version, as promised. Suggestions are welcome and please make tickets for bugs. Thanks :D

* New warning boolean - "type" which holds the type of ban. Time is also put in its own field. Warning level was moved down.
* Can't mute,ban already muted,banned players.
* New fc_bans.mute.check and fc_bans.ban.check fc_Bans.warn.check permissions.
* Standard error library created to optimize and sync code greatly.
* Updated warning list format to be a lot more useful now.
* Add warning delete sub-command, requires fc_bans.warn.delete to use.
* Updated the length that you can mute/ban for. Using a new far better method with Calenders that I should have just used, but was lazy. :P
* Any ban that is 52ws+ is considered permanent. If you want to unban a permanent ban then use the /unban command.
* /ban remove [name] command added. Requires fc_bans.ban.remove permission node.
* /mute remove [name] command added. Requires fc_bans.mute.remove permission node.
* New permission node, FC_Bans.user. Required to view help. Will have other uses later possibly.
* New permissions node, FC_Bans.immune. Makes you immune to kicks/bans/warns/mutes.
* New permission node, FC_Bans.admin. Gives access to every command. You still need the immune command with this, or you can just use fc_bans.*. Will be needed to change configuration settings with /fc_bans command.
* Configuration settings are now in, also made sure that userWarnings can be updated through config in the future.
* New Command fc_bans global to accompany global announcements setting. Needs fc_bans.admin to use and see in help.
* /ban ip [name] [duration] [reasons] is now usable.
* Can no longer message muted players either. A message is sent back telling the person that the person they are trying to chat to is muted.
* Brand new color scheme. :) Used the sexy GRAY + YELLOW SCHEME. Seeing that bold yellow WILL, and I mean WILL make you jizz yourself. 100% chance.
* Help command is made a lot better, use it... and use it often!
* Next version will offer a way to export bans, but for now nothing implemented. 

Please delete your configuration file when upgrading. You won't have to do this in the future unless I need to do major code rewrites, which even still, you probably wouldn't have to. :)
